# About

My research area revolves around studying people's interactions with technologies by combining user research techniques and qualitative analysis methods to develop user timelines and narratives that map how people learn to use and adapt technology.

In particular, my PhD work investigates how people learn to design and write programs by exploring the cognitive factors involved in computing and problem solving, human interactions with tools and technology (e.g. IDEs, software, and languages), and the contexts in which they are learning (e.g. functional/OO and computing pedagogy).
