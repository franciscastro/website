### **About**

I am a PhD candidate at the [WPI Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.wpi.edu) and a Visiting Researcher at the [Brown University Department of Computer Science](https://cs.brown.edu/).

My research and interests revolve around understanding human cognition and behavior in people's use of computational tools and technologies. I explore how people develop mental models about computational tools, how these mental models shape their interactions and workflows with their tools, as well as how people's environments and contexts influence these interactions.

### **Understanding programmer cognition**

Together with [Dr. Kathi Fisler](http://cs.brown.edu/~kfisler/), I am actively studying how learners, particularly novice-programmers, learn to design programs by exploring the cognitive factors involved in programming and problem-solving, learners' interactions with their tools (e.g. programming languages and IDEs), and the influence of their learning contexts in their programming (e.g. pedagogy and paradigms). My work lies at the intersection of the learning sciences, computer science education, and human-computer interaction. In 2017, I received the **Best Paper award** at the [Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research](https://www.kolicalling.fi/index.php/previous-koli-calling-conferences/koli-calling-2017/general-information-2017) for my work on developing a [novel multi-faceted taxonomy of program-design skills](publication/koli-2017-1).

### **Early work**

I began studying human behavior by designing computer simulations based on social psychology theories to model pedestrian movement within buildings and during panic or emergency scenarios. My work in this area received Best Paper awards in 2012 ([NCITE](publication/pitj-2013), [UPLB](publication/uplb-sfrc-2012)). Around this time, I started working with [Dr. Didith Rodrigo](http://www.ateneo.edu/ls/sose/iscs/faculty/rodrigo-ma-mercedes-t) studying the [behavior and affective states of novice Java programmers](publication/jecr-2013). In 2013, I was part of a team that developed health-informatics solutions for underserved communities in the Philippines, where I explored the interactions of healthcare practitioners and end-users with mobile-based systems. Our work led to the development of a pioneering [mobile healthcare application](publication/mdm-2014) designed for communities in the Philippines.
