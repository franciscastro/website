abstract = "Problem solving through effective plan decomposition and composition continues to be exceedingly difficult for novice programmers. This is exacerbated by the fact that these strategies are usually implicit in instruction: students are left to figure out their own problem solving strategies. My research investigates ways to elicit and improve students' plan decomposition and composition strategies."
